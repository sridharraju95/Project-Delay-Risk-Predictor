The Project Delay Risk Predictor aims to identify whether a project task is likely to be delayed based on historical data, helping managers intervene early to reduce slippage. The model used was an XGBoost Classifier, selected for its strong performance on structured data, ability to capture non-linear relationships, and built-in feature importance scoring. To evaluate the model, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix were usedâ€”placing special emphasis on recall to ensure actual delays are correctly flagged. The model revealed that Actual_Duration was the most critical factor influencing delay predictions, followed by Planned_Duration, Issues, and Dependency_Level, while Team_Size and Priority had minimal impact. Overall, the model provides actionable insights to improve project planning and execution
